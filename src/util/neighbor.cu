/*! \brief neighbor calculation

  For a given neighbor index this calculates the neighbors global position.
  The neighbor index is a number representing the position of the neighbor in the neighborhood of the individual.
  It is organized rowwise starting at the top-left individual in the neighborhood (index = 0). When there is an
  overflow in any of the directions, the global index will be wrapped around to the other side of the population.

  \param[in] x the x position of the original individual
  \param[in] y the y position of the original individual
  \param[in] neighbor_index the position of the neighbor relative to the original. Allowed values depend on the population size.

  \return the global index of the neighbor
